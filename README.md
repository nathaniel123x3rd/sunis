## My Modifications: 
1. Only works if the sentence ends with a question mark.<br>
2. Sends the response in a beautiful embed instead of a regular message. <br>
> ○ Puts the title of the embed as the overview of the prompt.  
> ○ Sets the author and author icon to the senders name and profile.
> ○ Puts the timezone of NewYork and current day in the footer
> ○ Shows the amount of words and characters used.
3. Divides each section of information into its own labeled section, leading to a neater overall look.
